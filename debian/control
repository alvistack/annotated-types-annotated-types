Description: Reusable constraint types to use with typing.Annotated
 This package provides metadata objects which can be used to represent
 common constraints such as upper and lower bounds on scalar values and
 collection sizes, a Predicate marker for runtime checks, and
 descriptions of how we intend these metadata to be interpreted. In some
 cases, we also note alternative representations which do not require
 this package.
